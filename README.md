# PWA

The app is a PWA wich can be installed in you desktop or smartphone.

<br/>

# Choises

Quasar was chosen because it makes ease to create application with one single code base for many plataforms, besides PWA, SSR etc. Also, Quasar increase development speed for having many components out of the box.<br/>
Typescript was used at the beginning, but I had a compatibility issue on the second day of development and decided to put TS aside. It's a small project and I didn't have much time to spend on the setup. Tailwind is the first choice for styling the application, but... same problem.
